          Affiliative behavior defining high-quality close relationships
        </h3>
        <h5>
        Affiliative behavior is the currency of close relationships. The behaviors we engage in with other people—like touching and sharing joy—can bring us closer together. They can signal a successful social interaction, be diagnostic of the state of a relationship, and even serve as a marker of individual well-being. My research investigates the factors that promote affiliative behavior.

        Inflammation is a social compass
        </h3>
        <h5>
        The inflammation we have in our body is constantly fluctuating in response to our social environment. How does inflammation facilitate interactions with those we are closest to? Does fluctuating inflammation shape changes in affiliative behavior toward close others? Recent theorizing and research within psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) has begun to suggest that inflammation may draw us toward safe support providers during times of need, such as when sick. My research investigates this novel idea, using mild inflammatory challenges like the influenza vaccine to induce a mild inflammatory response and study corresponding changes to social perceptions and behavior to various social targets.

        Compatibility in emerging relationships
        </h3>
        <h5>
        Scientists still do not know what makes two people compatible as friends or romantic partners. This gap in understanding means we cannot predict which relationships will be successful from their earliest encounters. To begin to answer this question, we need to look at the whole relationship, from before it begins through its formation and maintenance. This approach importantly integrates relationship traditions that are traditionally studied separately. We also need to look upstream at the behavioral and physiological processes underpinning the formation of new relationships. I have been advancing these goals in several different ways in my work on relationship initiation. As an example, I have developed a framework to better understand initial romantic interactions (and what gives rise to compatibility between two people when they first meet) by conceptualizing these interactions through the biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat. These ideas were the basis of an NSF SBE Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (SPRF) Proposal, which I was awarded in July 2024 (Award abstract #2404626).
